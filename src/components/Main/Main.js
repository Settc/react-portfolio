                    I'm a full-stack web developer for hire, living in Columbus, Ohio.
                    In addition to
                    attending a web developer bootcamp at Ohio State University,
                    I continue to seek education in other languages that catch my
                    fancy such as C#, Python, and C++. I also have an interest
                    in physical computing, so I love using Python to do cool stuff
                    with my Raspberry Pi. 
                    <hr />

                    Outside of my professional life, I love cooking, Formula 1,
                    and going to the gym. My dream is to get a job in motorsports
                    (whether that's in web development or otherwise) and I'd love
                    to relocate.
